There is a variable there written as api_key that has its value which was written as an asterisks sign
For the asterisks sighs written as "*****************", My api key is suppose to be in there, but we all have our unique api key when a user sign into his or her openweathermap website.
After signing into your openweathermap website click on your username above, you will see a pop up that says my API keys, then you will see your own api key
For sample sake it will be written like this "cb60a9b27e43a2afb3cdcea5e89ec4df".

Then for the account_sid variable. you can get your own account sid when you  sign into your twilio account.
Then Scroll down you will see your account sid there. then copy and replace.
Same thing goes for auth token.
